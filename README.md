Compose technology from Android is simply amazing. With less than 100 lines of code, I can easily create stunning user interfaces that are both efficient and effective. The official Android tutorial has shown me how to harness this power, and I'm confident that I can create exceptional user experiences with ease. These are what I have learned so far :

1. Defining composable functions
2. Adding different elements to the composable
3. Structuring your UI component using layout composables
4. Extending composables by using modifiers
5. Creating an efficient list
6. Keeping track of state and modifying it
7. Adding user interaction on a composable
8. Animating messages while expanding them
